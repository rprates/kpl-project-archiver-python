# kpl-project-archiver-python
Project archiver for issues

# Usage

Generate a GitHub API Token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
and save it in a env var called `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` with:

```
export GITHUB_API_TOKEN='my-generated-token'
```

This project uses the Express SendGrid Key. You need to set a env variable for that too.
If you havent this key, contact the archtecture team.

```
export SENDGRID_API_KEY="<SEND_GRID_KEY>"
```
